# Abrasion-Ablation Monte Carlo for Colliders or AAMCC

Abrasion-Ablation Monte Carlo for Colliders (AAMCC) is Monte-Carlo model specially desined to describe spectator matter production in a wide range 
of colliding nuclei and energy of the collision on the event-by-event basis

## Main assumtions of AAMCC
 
 - Nucleus-nucleus collisions are simulated by means of the Glauber Monte Carlo model. Non-participated nucleons form spectator matter (prefragment).
 - Excitation energy of prefragment can be calculated via one of 4 parametrization: 
   - Ericson formula
   - Gamaird-Schmidt formula
   - ALADIN collaboration parametrization
   - Hybrid approach. Excitation energy is calculated as follows:
     - in peripheral collisions with less then ~15% of removed nucleons the particle-hole model is used 2) (Ericson formula);
     - otherwise a parabolic ALADIN approximation 3) is applied with parameters tuned to data obtained in nuclear emulsions.
 - Decays of prefragments are simulated as follows:
   - pre-equilibrium decays modelled with MST-clustering algorithm;
   - Fermi break-up model from Geant4 v9.2;
   - Multifragmentation is caclated via one of two approaches: SMM in realisation of Geant4 v10.4 (options AAMCC or G4), ABLAXX (option ABLAXX).
   - Evaporation-fission calculation can be carried out via one of two models: ABLAXX evaporation (options ABLAXX or AAMCC) or Weisskopf-Ewing (option G4) evaporation, both adopted from Geant4 v10.4.
